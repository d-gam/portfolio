• Utilized Postman to interact with the JSON Placeholder REST API and perform various API operations,
including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage data.
• Created a Postman collection to organize and store all API requests for streamlined testing and
execution.
• Implemented CRUD operations
• Developed and executed a collection-level script to check the response time for each API request,
ensuring it was under 250 milliseconds. The script automatically flagged requests that exceeded the time
limit.
• Verified the accuracy, reliability, and performance of API responses, enhancing skills in API testing and
automation.
