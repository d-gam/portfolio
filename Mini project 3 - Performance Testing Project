Designed performance test scenarios by defining realistic user interactions and modeling appropriate workloads to simulate actual usage.
• Developed JMeter test scripts to effectively replicate user behavior and interactions with a complex web application.
• Executed performance tests on a new web application to assess its response time, scalability, and stability under varying user loads.
• Analyzed test results by monitoring system performance, identifying bottlenecks, and evaluating the overall efficiency of the application.
• Suggested improvements based on test findings, providing actionable insights to enhance application performance and optimize resource usage.
